<h2>About</h2>
<p>
Since bursting on to the Silicon Valley scene more than two decades ago, the 52-year-old serial entrepreneur has kept the public captivated with his business antics.
The boss of X (formerly Twitter), Tesla and SpaceX is the world's richest person and uses his platform to make his views known on a vast array of topics.
He has also charged ahead with human brain chip trials at his firm Neuralink, played with turning X into a super app and tried to play a bigger role in the fast-growing world of artificial intelligence, despite having warned it could lead to humanity's extinction.
In late February 2024 he sued OpenAI and its chief executive Sam Altman, saying the firm he helped co-found had reneged on its non-profit, open source origins by hitching its wagon to Microsoft.

<h2>My Opinion</h2>

Musk takes great risks, moves fast, and creates a sense of urgency. These things have helped him accomplish amazing things. A new Musk biography by Walter Isaacson illuminates how his brutal childhood and negative traits have helped him accomplish these things.</p>
